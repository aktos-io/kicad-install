# Intention

This layout is specifically designed to ensure building Kicad from a specific commit in order to make all team members run exactly the same version of Kicad, thus allowing all members exchange their projects coherently.

# Usage

```
./prepare.sh  # for the first time
./build-kicad.sh 
./create-deb-pkg.sh # in order to generate a deb package
```
